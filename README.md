# Catering Menu

Catering Menu is a web application designed to showcase a catering service's menu and facilitate online food ordering. The website features authentic Indian cuisine including special items like Chicken 65, Biryani, Traditional Thali, and various desserts.

The application provides an easy-to-use interface where customers can browse the menu categories such as Appetizers, Main Course, and Desserts. Users can create accounts to place orders and track their order history. The admin panel allows the restaurant staff to manage menu items and handle customer orders efficiently.

Built using Python Flask for the backend and modern web technologies for the frontend, this project demonstrates a practical implementation of a restaurant management system with user authentication and database integration.
